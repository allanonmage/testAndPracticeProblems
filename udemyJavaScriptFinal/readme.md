This is the final project in this class.  It's guided through the video just like everything else, but you're supposed to follow along.

The idea is to make a basic web page that pulls in the weather from a user selectable zip code.  To do that, you need to sign up for a weather service, use it's API to pull data, parse input by the user, etc.

This wsa Javascrip class, so we used JavaScript and HTML.  The CSS that was used was provided b the instructor.
