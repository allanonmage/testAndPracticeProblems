# testAndPracticeProblems


I will upload test problems and practice problems that I work on.  I figured it would be More Better(TM) to use a single repository rather than make a new one for each problem.

The title will be self descriptive, and the top comments will explain the problem and language used, and anything else I find relevent.

If the problem came from a job interview/performance test, I will not label the source, other wise I will lalbel where the problem came from.
